To take input in Node.js, you can use the `readline` module, which provides an interface for reading data from a readable stream (like the terminal). Hereâ€™s how you can set it up to accept user input:

 Steps to Take Input in Node.js:

1. Import the `readline` module:

javascript
const readline = require('readline');


2. Create an interface for input and output:

javascript
const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,  // Standard input (keyboard)
  output: process.stdout // Standard output (console)
});


3. Prompt the user for input:

javascript
rl.question('What is your name? ', (answer) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${answer}!`);
  rl.close();  // Close the input stream
});


 Full Example Code:

javascript
const readline = require('readline');

// Create an interface for input/output
const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
});

// Ask the user a question and handle the response
rl.question('What is your name? ', (answer) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${answer}!`);
  
  // Close the readline interface after receiving input
  rl.close();
});


 How it works:
- `rl.question` prompts the user with a question (`'What is your name?'` in this case).
- The second argument is a callback function that gets executed when the user provides an answer. The user's input will be passed into the `answer` parameter.
- After the answer is processed, `rl.close()` closes the interface, terminating the input stream.

 Example Output:

$ node inputExample.js
What is your name? Alice
Hello, Alice!
